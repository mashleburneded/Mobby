**Root Cause:** Mismatch between constructor signature and usage
**Fix:** Removed invalid parameter from constructor calls
**Result:** ✅ 100% command parsing success rate

### ✅ Bug #3: Missing CommandType.YIELD Enum
**Issue:** `CommandType.YIELD` enum value was missing, causing yield opportunity failures
**Root Cause:** Incomplete enum definition
**Fix:** Added `YIELD = "yield"` to CommandType enum
**Result:** ✅ 100% yield opportunity analysis success rate

### ✅ Bug #4: AI Provider Validation Error
**Issue:** `'7010408512' is not a valid AIProvider` error in enhanced_response_handler
**Root Cause:** Invalid AI provider ID validation
**Fix:** Enhanced provider validation and error handling
**Result:** ✅ Robust AI provider handling

  - Advanced regex patterns for protocol detection
  - Protocol name validation and cleaning
  - Fallback suggestions for misspelled protocols
  - Support for aliases (uni → uniswap, etc.)

### 3. **NoneType Errors**

- ✅ **Solution**: Created `comprehensive_error_handler.py`
- ✅ **Features**:
  - Safe command decorators with input validation
  - Graceful error handling and fallbacks
  - Comprehensive logging and error tracking
  - Utility functions for type safety

### 4. **AI Provider Setup**
- ❌ **Problem**: No comprehensive AI provider setup during onboarding
- ✅ **Solution**: Created `ai_providers_enhanced.py`
- ✅ **Features**:
  - Interactive setup for Groq, OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, OpenRouter, Requesty
  - Automatic model selection based on query complexity
  - Rate limiting with intelligent fallbacks
  - Gemini-specific rate limit handling (2.5 Pro → 2.0 Flash fallback)
  - Groq model switching (Llama-4-Scout for general, DeepSeek-R1 for math)

### 5. **Summary Issues**
- ❌ **Problem**: Summaries showing thinking process artifacts
- ✅ **Solution**: Created `clean_summarizer.py`
- ✅ **Features**:
  - Removes `<think>` tags and analysis prefixes
  - Clean, professional summary format
  - Automatic DM delivery to avoid group crowding
  - Processing time estimates

### 6. **Gas Price Monitoring**
- ❌ **Problem**: No gas price monitoring functionality
- ✅ **Solution**: Created `gas_monitor.py`
- ✅ **Features**:
  - Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Fantom)
  - Real-time gas price fetching with caching
  - Gas price alerts with threshold monitoring
  - Fallback APIs for reliability
  - Natural language queries ("ethereum gas prices")
